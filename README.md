Application created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was created with the intention of practicing my skills in these three programming languages and basically consists of emitting sounds whenever the user clicks on the options displayed on the screen. It was one of my first codes, and I will leave it here for portfolio expansion purposes.
